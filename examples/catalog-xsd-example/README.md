# Library Catalog XML Schema Example

This example is provided for CS598 Foundations of Data Curation Assignment 2 Part 1: XML Schema Design. It is intended to provide a basic example of document selection, creation of the assocaited XML schema and resulting markup. It is not intended as a complete solution.
 
## Document selection

The document selected for this example is a record from the UIUC library catalog for the book [XML Schema Essentials](https://i-share-uiu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99444534012205899&context=L&vid=01CARLI_UIU:CARLI_UIU&search_scope=NewDiscoveryNetwork&tab=Everything&lang=en) by Wyke and Wyatt. 

* The "Print" feature was used to get a simplified representation of the catalog data, stored in the file "uiuc-catalog-record-print.pdf".
* The "contents" field is treated as-is (i.e., text field)
* The "related titles" field is not included

The XML Schema was developed using the  Oxygen XML Editor.
