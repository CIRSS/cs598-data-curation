## Course Description

Data curation, the management of data in support of analysis and use, is a
critical activity within data science. Without adequate data curation data
cannot be used effectively, efficiently, or reliably. Because of its importance
and its challenging nature, data curation typically involves more time,
jttention, staff, and expenditures, than does data analytics.  Activities of
particular concern to data curation are data modeling, integration, workflow
management, format conversion, provenance documentation, preservation, integrity
and validity determination, data cleaning, standards conformance, identifier
management, metadata management, retrieval support, re-use issues, governance,
regulatory compliance, and security, among others. This course provides a survey
of theoretical and practical topics in data curation.

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course. Weekly readings supplement
lecture videos and can be found on the overview page for each week. Concepts
covered in required readings are included in quizzes and the final exam.

## Time commitment

This 4-credit hour course is 16 weeks long. You should invest 10-12 hours every week in this course.

## Expected Prior Knowledge

* Completion of an introductory databases course such as Database Systems (CS411) or related experience:
  * Database basics: database design, schemas, constraints, queries
  * Conceptual modeling, entity relationship diagrams
* Ability to create and manipulate commonly used data formats including JSON and XML.
* Basic Python programming skills including familiarity with Pandas, use of Python libraries, and web-based APIs.


## Course Expectations

Unlike other courses in data science programs, introductor data curation courses
are not primarily concerned with learning analytic techniques and instead focus
on many other aspects of the data lifecycle.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will:
- Recognize the importance of physical and logical data independence as critical
  system requirements and be able to identify data curation strategies that use
  abstraction and indirection to achieve those requirements.
- Recognize how key data abstraction strategies are related to each other both
  at the same level of abstraction and also across levels of abstraction. 
- Understand the role of conceptual modeling, ontologies, and knowledge graphs in data modeling.
- Learn a framework of fundamental concepts of data representation.
- Recognize the common challenges in data integration, and how they can be addressed.
- Recognize the importance of workflow management and provenance documentation
  in ensuring efficiency, trustworthiness, and reproducibility.
- Understand the trade-offs for common data preservation strategies.
- Recognize the complex problems with data set identity at different levels of
  abstraction and be familiar with challenges in determining both data identity
  and data representation identity.  
- Understand the cross-cutting importance of metadata in data curation activities.
- Recognize the different kinds and levels of data standards and the different
  levels of both data conformance and processor conformance. 
- Recognize the relevance of empirical research on the information behavior of
  data creators, managers, analysts, and users.  
- Recognize the distinctive data curation needs of machine learning.
- Recognize how machine learning can help address curatorial problems.
- Be familiar with the of significance of governance, policy, law, and ethics in data science.

## Elements of this Course

The course is comprised of the following elements:

* **Lecture Videos**. For each module, the concepts you need to know will be presented through a collection of short video lectures. You may stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles or download the videos to watch locally. The videos usually total 1.5 to 2 hours for each module. You generally should spend at least the same amount of time digesting content in the video. 
* **Readings**. Readings are included in each module to supplement and reinforce lecture materials. Concepts from **required readings** are included in module quizzes. Supplemental readings are optional and provided for students who want to explore a particular are in more depth.
* **Module Quizzes**. Each module concludes with a graded quiz to help ensure you understood that module's content. You will be allowed only three attempts for each quiz.
* **Assignments**. There are four assignments for you to complete in this course. Assignments are delivered via the PrairieLearn system.
* **Exams**. Midterm and final exams.
* **Participation**. Student participation will be based on engagement via Campuswire and office hours.
* **Extra Credit**. At least two extra credit opportunities will be available worth approximately 3% of the final grade.

## Campuswire Policy

Do not post complete solutions publicly. While the intent is to get hlep, posting solutions may encourage cheating.

Submit to Instructors and TAs for detailed feedback on your solution to a problem. Course staff will provide private feedback.

If content posted to Campuswire is too detailed, course staff reserve the right to remove content or change the post to private at any time.


## Student Code and Policies

A student at the University of Illinois at the Urbana‑Champaign campus is a
member of a University community of which all members have at least the rights
and responsibilities common to all citizens, free from institutional censorship;
affiliation with the University as a student does not diminish the rights or
responsibilities held by a student or any other community member as a citizen of
larger communities of the state, the nation, and the world. See the [University
of Illinois Student Code](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/index.html) for more information.


## Academic Integrity
All students are expected to abide by [campus regulations on academic integrity
found in the Student Code of
Conduct](http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html). These standards will be enforced and infractions of these rules will not be tolerated in this course. Sharing, copying, or providing any part of a homework solution or code is an infraction of the University’s rules on academic integrity. We will be actively looking for violations of this policy in homework and project submissions. Any violation will be punished as severely as possible with sanctions and penalties typically ranging from a failing grade on this assignment up to a failing grade in the course, including a letter of the offending infraction kept in the student's permanent university record.
Again, a good rule of thumb: _Keep every typed word and piece of code your own_. If you think you are operating in a gray area, you probably are. If you would like clarification on specifics, please contact the course staff.
