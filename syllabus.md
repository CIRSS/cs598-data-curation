## Course Description

Data curation, the management of data in support of analysis and use, is a
critical activity within data science. Without adequate data curation data
cannot be used effectively, efficiently, or reliably. Because of its importance
and its challenging nature, data curation typically involves more time,
attention, staff, and expenditures, than does data analytics.  Activities of
particular concern to data curation are data modeling, integration, workflow
management, format conversion, provenance documentation, preservation, integrity
and validity determination, data cleaning, standards conformance, identifier
management, metadata management, retrieval support, re-use issues, governance,
regulatory compliance, and security, among others. This course provides a survey
of theoretical and practical topics in data curation.

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course, but there are weekly required and optional
readings that can be found in each weekly overview page.

## Time commitment

This 4-credit hour course is 16 weeks long. You should invest 10-12 hours every week in this course.


## Prerequisites
Basic programming skills are required. Although the course also assumes that
most students will have some familiarity with relational databases, conceptual
modeling, and markup languages, these will be briefly reviewed as needed.

## Course Expectations

Unlike other courses in data science programs, introductory data curation
courses are not primarily concerned with learning particular analytic techniques
and instead focus on recognizing curatorial challenges, analyzing those
challenges, identifying interventions, and justifying recommendations. As such,
assignments include fewer problem sets or programming projects and more written
explanations.

Students often find that providing the code, schema or solution for an exercise
is not as difficult as describing the anlaysis behind a decision. While written
responses may feel subjective, this is all the more reason to write carefully,
clearly, and in sufficient detail so that the thinking and analysis behind your
response is evident. In any case, this sort of subjectivity and complexity is
common in the worplace, as you likely already know.  If it helps, you can
imagine that you are justifying a proposal to a skeptical director of
engineering.

In addition, because the specific technical approaches to curatorial problems
change rapidly, we will be asking you to read more research articles and classic
discussions of basic principles. The fundamental ideas presented in these
articles will not change as rapidly as techniques and practices change, so these
will better prepare you for the challenges ahead and not just those of
the present.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will:
- Recognize the importance of physical and logical data independence as critical
  system requirements and be able to identify data curation strategies that use
  abstraction and indirection to achieve those requirements.
- Recognize how key data abstraction strategies are related to each other both
  at the same level of abstraction and also across levels of abstraction. 
- Understand the role of conceptual modeling, ontologies, and knowledge graphs in data modeling.
- Learn a framework of fundamental concepts of data representation.
- Recognize the common challenges in data integration, and how they can be addressed.
- Recognize the importance of workflow management and provenance documentation
  in ensuring efficiency, trustworthiness, and reproducibility.
- Understand the trade-offs for common data preservation strategies.
- Recognize the complex problems with data set identity at different levels of
  abstraction and be familiar with challenges in determining both data identity
  and data representation identity.  
- Understand the cross-cutting importance of metadata in data curation activities.
- Recognize the different kinds and levels of data standards and the different
  levels of both data conformance and processor conformance. 
- Recognize the relevance of empirical research on the information behavior of
  data creators, managers, analysts, and users.  
- Recognize the distinctive data curation needs of machine learning.
- Recognize how machine learning can help address curatorial problems.
- Be familiar with the of significance of governance, policy, law, and ethics in data science.


## Grade Policy

Grading is based on Assignments, Quizzes and Final Exam. Each Graded Assessment typically carries 20%
weightage.

| A            | 90%                            | B            | 80%            | D            | 60%            |
| A-           | 88%                            | B-           | 78%            | F            | Below 58%      |


## Grading

1. Quizzes (10%): The lowest grade will be dropped out of 14 weekly quizzes
1. Assignments (18% each): There will be 4 mini project style assignments
3. Final exam (18%): The final exam will cover the entire semester


## Assigment Deadlines

For all assignment deadlines, please refer to the Course Assignment Deadlines,
Late Policy, and Academic Calendar page in Coursera

## Late Policy

Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due at 11:59 PM US Central Time
on the due date. Considering the large size of this class, we typically DO NOT
accept any late assignments. We encourage everyone to finish the assignments
before the deadline. Please do not email the staff requesting to accept
assignment with late penalty. In case of extenuating circumstances extensions
are granted at the discretion of course staff. In such circumstances please
reach out to TAs or post email to mcs-support@illinois.edu.

## Academic Integrity

You are welcome to discuss assignments with your classmates, but do not
show or share any code. Also, you may not use any code from the Internet or any other outside
sources, unless it is specifically approved by the instructor. Be sure to acknowledge any help that you do get from other students or outside works, even if it’s just a small suggestion. Violations will go on record at the university, and the minimum penalty will be a zero for the entire assignment. Read Here These standards will be enforced and infractions of these rules will not be tolerated in this course. Sharing, copying, or providing any part of a homework solution or code is an infraction of the University’s rules on academic integrity. We will be actively looking for violations of this policy in homework submissions. Any violation will be punished as severely as possible with sanctions and penalties typically ranging from a failing grade on this assignment up to a failing grade in the course, including a letter of the offending infraction kept in the student’s permanent university
record. Again, a good rule of thumb: Keep every typed word and piece of code your own. If you
think you are operating in a gray area, you probably are. If you would like clarification on specifics, please contact the course staff.

## Elements of this Course

The course is comprised of the following elements:

* **Lecture Videos**. In each week, the concepts you need to know will be presented through a collection of short video lectures. You may stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles or download the videos. You may also download the slides that go along with the videos. The videos usually total 1.5 to 2 hours each week. You generally should spend at least the same amount of time digesting content in the video. The actual amount of time needed to digest the content will vary based on your background.
* **Orientation Quiz**. The purpose of the orientation quiz is to ensure that you have gone through the orientation module and acquired the necessary information about the course before you start it. The orientation quiz is a required activity, but it's not part of the course grading. You have unlimited attempts on the orientation quiz. You need to answer all questions correctly in order to pass the orientation quiz.
* **Weekly Quizzes**. Each week concludes with an ungraded quiz to help ensure you understood that week's content. You will be allowed unlimited attempts for each quiz, and there is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz. 
* **Exercises**. There are four exercises for you to complete in this course, each of which will account for 20% of your final grade. You will submit this assignment for peer review to get feedback from your classmates. You will then incorporate the feedback you receive and submit a final version of your exercise to the instructor and TAs for grading. One of the assignment is a programming assignment which will run through coursera notebook, this assignment does not require you submit anything for peer review but will be graded based on the hidden test cases and supporting report you will submit for grading. **You will be allowed one submission attempt for these exercises, except for the programming assignment which has multiple attempts until its deadline**. Though you are encouraged to discuss these assignments with your classmates, everyone must submit their own work.
* **Final Exam** This year the course concludes with a final exam. It will account for 20% of your final grade. The details of final exam are being worked out and will be conveyed soon.
