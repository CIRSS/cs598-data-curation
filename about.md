# Welcome

Data curation is the management of data in support of analysis, use, and reuse.
It is a critical activity within data science (and, more broadly, across the
sciences). Without adequate curation, data cannot be understood or used effectively,
efficiently, or reliably. Activities of particular concern include data
modeling, cleaning, integration, identity, integrity and validity determination,
standards conformance, metadata management, retrieval, governance, regulatory
compliance, and security, among others.

This course provides a survey of theoretical and practical topics in data
curation.
