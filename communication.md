 # Communication

```{admonition} Update
Course website and materials are currently being revised in preparation for Fall 2025.
```

This course uses Campuswire for communication. This will be your go-to place to
ask course content related questions, or for clarification on lecture videos and
course assignments. Before you post a question, check if someone has already
asked your question. The instructor and TA will attempt to answer questions
within 24-48 hours after questions are posted. It does not mean that you should
post questions at the last minute, e.g., 10 minutes before the deadline. It is
highly recommended to check the Campuswire forum at least twice a day.
